:: Maid - Start
<<run setup.equipOutfit($player, "maid", "stash")>>Approaching Brenda sitting by the receptionist desk, you wave and smile at her.
<<= setup.speak($characters.brenda, "Another day of cleaning I suppose?")>>
You nod and pass her going into the backroom, where you find your maid outfit and promptly wear it.

Strutting back out you prepare for another day as the face of eVentia, cleaning client hotel rooms.
