:: Receptionist - Start
You approach Brenda sitting by the receptionist desk.

<<= setup.speak($player, "Sure am.")>>

You put on your receptionist outfit in the backroom. ItÂ´s familiar tightening grip proving less of a challenge every time. 
Before moving on, you take one gander in the mirror. The short and tight top exposing your curves and mid-riff make you shuffle it around a bit, before settling.

Strutting back out you prepare for another day as the face of eVentia, receiving clients, organizing event girls and answering questions from whomever might need them.
