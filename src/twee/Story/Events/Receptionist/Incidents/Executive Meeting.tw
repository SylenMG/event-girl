<</nobr>>You frown at him.
<<= setup.speak($player, "Fuck you bro! IÂ´m not your fucking puppet!", "angry")>>
Brenda almost chokes on her coffee as all three executives just stand there, mouths dropped and frozen in shock.
<<= setup.speak($characters.brenda, "Oh shi-*cough*! Uh! Sorry! She did NOT mean that! Let me take you there now!", "surprised")>>
The executives all look visibly shaken, grasping for words as Brenda frantically drag them away from the desk.
<<= setup.speak($characters.brenda, "Come now, this way!", "smile")>>
She sends you a stern view of judgement before dissapearing around the corner, escorting the suits to their conference room.
