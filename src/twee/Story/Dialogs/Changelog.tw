0.5
- New Event Framework, to ease better handling of events.
- More Options for existing events based on the psyche and skills of the player.
- Options: If the player's mind stat is above a certain point, they will be unable to do their job properly and be a drooling slut that anyone can take advantage of.
- Options: If the player's lust stat is too high, more lusty options may appear that will inevitably increase their femininity.
- Events: Earnings/Pay is now done differently. The player has an E-rating that may influence this across all events. Being a good girl will increase your rating whilst being a disobedient brat will tank it.
- Lust is now a factor and a new Psyche attribute.
- Lust builds up slowly from event outcomes, time, drugs or similar and must be relieved through masturbation, meditation, medication or similar.
- The player must now balance their Mind and Lust or lose control to their desires.
- Meditation: A new way to clear the mind and lower lust. Do it in the pod. (Currently drastically lowers both, as there are no other options currently).
- Masturbation: Will reset your desire for lust, unless certain conditions have been met.
- New Mental Framework: The player will now make comments or have thoughts on their current situation as the game progresses. These trigger when moving around or similar.
- New Clothing/Vendor Framework: Whilst entirely technical (you might not notice a difference), made a new framework for clothing, that should hopefully make things more smooth from now on.
- New Modular Psyche/Skill Framework: changed the way psyche and skills are handled, also very technical and unlikely that you will notice a difference.
- Various other technical changes, more of the code is now kept outside Twine in general.
- Emergency Exit has been added to the menu, it will show when in debug mode. Debug mode can be turned on in the menu.
- Debug Menu: Updated to look nicer and categorized it.
- Debug Menu: You can now debug all event incidents on their own, alter stats easier, debug wardrobe better etc.

- Added Anal sex functionality to the sex system.
- All sex scenes now have a dominant version as well, as compared to a submissive pov.
- Added 1 new stripper incident (Anal).
- Added 9 new therapy sessions.
- Therapy sessions allow you to increase your Femininity, Slut or Bimbo psyche to full.
- Auction House has been added.
- You may now set up your vaginal virgnity for auctioning.
- Requires some extra testing as it is using a lot of different scripts in an attempt to weave it together in a managable way.
- Added 1 new receptionist incident.
- Added 1 new maid incident.
- Added a lot of new commentary during sex scenes.
- Completely changed the framework around how a lot of things are handled by scripts.
- This should allow for easier mental changes to impact how the player character behaves during certain situations (started the work on this).

0.3
- Added new functionality to debugging.
- Added several new clothes/underwear:
- Red Lace Bra/Panties.
- Black Corset.
- White Lace Panties.
- Long-sleeved Top.
- Denim Skirt.
- Grey Jeans.

- Added new functionality surrounding Events: Instance
- Instance Events have a chance of being available every day, check the event board for it's availability. They generally pay better than Recurring events.
- New Event: Car Show Girl, with 2 different Incidents.
- Receptionist: 2 new Incidents.
- Maid: 2 new Incidents.
- Stripper: 1 new Incidents.
- Sex System: Regular Intercourse is now supported.
- Sex System: Both blowjob and sex propositions now choose from a random pool of clients, providing variety.
- Endings: First Two Endings have been written and added (Pay off your debt to experience them).
- Therapy: Femininity, Sluttyness and Bimbofication is now tied together. This is ordered as Bimbo > Slut > Feminine. This means that if Bimbo reaches level 1, then it bumps up Slut and Feminine to level 1 automatically. This change is to properly illustrate that a Bimbo is a feminine slut. A slut is feminine. But someone feminine, is not necessarily slutty or a bimbo.
- Therapy: Payouts for various sessions have now been properly changed to reflect the risk associated with their participation.
- Additionally a few bugfixes and text/grammar fixes.
- Scripts: I've begun exporting a lot of the game's functionality into Javascript that can then easily be used in other projects. (The Realm for an example).
